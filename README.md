# JPMCBOOK
It’s nearing the end of week 5 which means this summer intensive is almost over :((((.  We need a way to stay in contact during the school year but using social media is boring. Luckily, you guys have learned how to build and design webpages, forums and integrate APIs. Your task at hand is to create a JPMCBK website to help us stay in contact. You’re tasked with making a 3 page website: a homepage, a forum/chat page and a contact page. 

#Instructions:
Use command line to create a new project folder called “JPMCBOOK”
Create your typical website directory layout, including a “index.html”, “chat.html”, and “contact.html” file.

#Specifications:
“Index.html” should be the homepage of the site and should contain subsections detailing what went on in each week
        -->These should be bullet points with the site visit, the guest speaker(s) and a project (or two) that you worked on
“Contact.html” should exist as a database with information on each member of this cohort
        -->Each person should have their name, age, grade, and the school they’re attending
        -->Don’t forget Eric, Kermina, Abdul, and Kwesi!
“Chat.html” should be a simple messaging web application where users can input their username and message
        -->The chat should permanently hold all messages
Each page must contain a link/button to the other two pages
The website must be properly hosted on GitHub

Wireframe all three webpages and break down what each group member is responsible for
        -->Wireframes must be approved by Eric, Abdul or Kwesi!!!
Be sure to put your best effort forward as all groups will present at EOD!
Happy creating!

#Extra Credit:
Add pictures of each user to the contact page!
Kwesi will bring his camera and provide free headshots!!
Incorporate an API onto the Contact page
Give each contact their own song/gif/pokemon etc...
